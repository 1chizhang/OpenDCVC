# Introduction

Official Pytorch implementation for Neural Video Compression including:
* [Deep Contextual Video Compression](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/file/96b250a90d3cf0868c83f8c965142d2a-Paper.pdf), NeurIPS 2021, in [this foloder](./NeurIPS2021/).
* [Hybrid Spatial-Temporal Entropy Modelling for Neural Video Compression], ACM MM 2022, in [this folder](./ACMMM2022/)

# Acknowledgement
